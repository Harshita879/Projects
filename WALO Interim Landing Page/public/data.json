        "question":"What is RBF and how does it work on WALO?",
        "answer":"RBF stands for Revenue-Based Finance. Unlike traditional investments, you don't buy shares in a company. Instead, you invest in their revenue stream. This means your returns are directly tied to how much the company makes, creating a win-win scenario. On WALO, you browse businesses seeking RBF, choose an investment amount, and share in their future success as their revenue grows."
